### Header-Based Queue Routing üì§

The proxy supports routing requests to dedicated queues based on specific HTTP headers. This is particularly
useful for managing different authentication systems or API providers that require rate limiting.

#### Supported Headers by System

| System                          | Headers                                        | Description                                                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Services, claude cli** üîë | `X-Amz-Security-Token`                         | Routes AWS API requests with temporary credentials or IAM authentication |
| **ChatGPT/OpenAI** ü§ñ           | `Authorization`, `OpenAI-Organization`         | Handles OpenAI API requests with API keys and organization routing       |
| **Claude/Anthropic** üåê         | `Authorization`, `anthropic-version`           | Manages Anthropic API requests with proper versioning                    |
| **Google Cloud** ‚òÅÔ∏è             | `Authorization`, `X-Goog-User-Project`         | Routes Google Cloud API requests with project-specific billing           |
| **Azure** üü¶                    | `Authorization`, `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`   | Handles Azure API Management requests                                    |
| **Custom APIs** üîß              | `X-API-Key`, `Authorization`, `X-Custom-Token` | Generic headers for custom authentication systems                        |

#### Configuration Examples

```bash
# AWS-specific configuration
./proxy-queue -header-queues="X-Amz-Security-Token,Authorization" -target-host=xxx

# Environment variable approach 
export PROXY_HEADER_QUEUES="Authorization,X-Amz-Security-Token,OpenAI-Organization"
./proxy-queue
```

#### How Header Routing Works

1. **Request Analysis**: Incoming requests are inspected for configured headers
2. **Queue Selection**: Requests with matching headers are routed to dedicated queues
3. **Isolated Processing**: Each header-based queue processes requests independently
4. **Rate Limiting**: Different queues can have different processing rates and delays
5. **Fallback**: Requests without matching headers go to the main queue

#### Environment Configuration Example

```bash
# Copy and modify the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Or set environment variables directly
export PROXY_TARGET_HOST=api.example.com
export PROXY_TARGET_PORT=443
export PROXY_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export PROXY_HEADER_QUEUES=X-Amz-Security-Token
export PROXY_TIMEOUT=45  # 45 seconds timeout for all operations
./proxy-queue
```

### Service Ports

- **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy**: Listens on the specified port (default: 6789) üåê
- **Socket Proxy**: Listens on the specified port + 10 (default: 6799)
- **Health Checks**: Listens on health-port (default: 8081) OR on HTTP proxy port if `-shared-health-port=true`
  üö©
- **Metrics**: Listens on metrics-port (default: 9090) OR on HTTP proxy port if `-shared-metrics-port=true` üìä

## Examples

### HTTP Proxy

```bash
# Start proxy
./proxy-queue -target-host=httpbin.org -target-port=80 -https=false

# Test with curl
curl http://localhost:6789/get
```

### HTTPS Proxy

```bash
# Start HTTPS proxy
./proxy-queue -target-host=httpbin.org -target-port=443 -https=true

# Test with curl
curl http://localhost:6789/get
```

### Socket Proxy

```bash
# Start proxy
./proxy-queue -target-host=example.com -target-port=22

# Test with telnet or netcat (socket proxy runs on port + 10)
telnet localhost 6799
```

### Health Checks and Metrics

#### Separate Ports (Default) üîÑ

```bash
# Check application health
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Check readiness
curl http://localhost:8081/ready

# View Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

#### Shared Port Mode üåê

```bash
# Start proxy with shared ports
./proxy-queue -shared-health-port=true -shared-metrics-port=true

# Check application health (now on proxy port)
curl http://localhost:6789/health

# Check readiness (now on proxy port)
curl http://localhost:6789/ready

# View Prometheus metrics (now on proxy port)
curl http://localhost:6789/metrics
```

### Available Metrics

The application exposes the following Prometheus metrics:

- **`proxy_requests_total`** (Counter): Total number of proxy requests processed
- **`proxy_request_duration_seconds`** (Histogram): Duration of proxy requests in seconds
- **`proxy_queue_size`** (Gauge): Current number of requests in queue
- **`proxy_errors_total`** (Counter): Total number of proxy errors
- **`proxy_concurrent_requests`** (Gauge): Number of concurrent requests being processed

These metrics can be scraped by Prometheus and visualized using Grafana dashboards.

### Logging

The application uses structured JSON logging with the following features:

- **Configurable log levels**: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
- **Request tracking**: Each request gets a unique ID for end-to-end tracing
- **Detailed request/response logging**: At debug level, full HTTP headers, bodies, and socket data are logged
- **Performance metrics**: Request duration, queue length, and processing statistics
- **Connection details**: Client IPs, connection states, and data transfer amounts

Example debug log output:

```json
{
  "level": "debug",
  "msg": "üì• HTTP Request Details",
  "request_id": "http-1672531200123456789",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/api/data",
  "headers": { "User-Agent": "curl/7.81.0" },
  "remote_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.123456789Z"
}
```

#### Mixed Configuration

```bash
# Only health checks on shared port, metrics separate
./proxy-queue -shared-health-port=true

# Health checks on proxy port: http://localhost:6789/health
# Metrics still on separate port: http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### Development

```bash
# Development build with debug info
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Run tests with race detection
make test-race

# Format and lint code
make fmt
make lint
make vet
```

## How It Works

1. **Queue System**: All incoming requests (HTTP, HTTPS, socket) are added to either the main queue or
   header-specific queues based on configured header routing
2. **Header-Based Routing**: Requests with specific headers (e.g., `X-Amz-Security-Token`, `Authorization`)
   can be routed to dedicated queues for isolated processing
3. **Sequential Processing**: Requests are processed one by one in FIFO order by dedicated goroutines for each
   queue
4. **Configurable Delays**: After processing each request, the system waits for a random delay calculated
   between the configured min/max values
5. **Connection Forwarding**:
    - HTTP/HTTPS requests are forwarded with proper header and body copying, including SSL/TLS support
    - Socket connections use bidirectional data copying with enhanced logging and error handling
6. **Request Tracking**: Each request gets a unique ID for tracking throughout the processing pipeline
7. **Metrics Collection**: Real-time metrics are collected for requests, errors, queue size, processing
   duration, and concurrent operations across all queues
8. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health status monitoring with automatic degradation detection based on
   error rates, including per-queue status

## Dependencies

The project uses minimal external dependencies to ensure reliability and security:

- **[logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)** v1.9.3: Structured logging with JSON formatting
- **[prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang)** v1.23.2: Metrics collection and
  exposition

All dependencies are automatically managed through Go modules (`go.mod`/`go.sum`).

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security Features

- **TLS Support**: Configurable HTTPS/TLS for target connections with `InsecureSkipVerify` option
- **Client IP Detection**: Proper client IP extraction supporting `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable queue size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts for HTTP requests (default 30s), socket connections (default 30s), HTTP proxy responses (default 60s), and socket connection handling (default 300s) - all customizable via `-timeout` flag
- **Connection Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup and connection closing

### Performance Optimizations

- **Buffered Channels**: Queue implementation uses buffered channels for efficient request handling
- **Connection Pooling**: HTTP client with configurable transport settings
- **Concurrent Processing**: Separate goroutines for different protocol handlers
- **Memory Management**: 32KB buffers for socket data copying to balance memory usage and performance
- **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free counters for high-frequency metrics updates

### Operational Considerations

- **Queue Sizing**: Choose appropriate `PROXY_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` based on expected load and available memory
- **Delay Configuration**: Set `PROXY_DELAY_MIN`/`PROXY_DELAY_MAX` according to target server capacity
- **Timeout Configuration**: Set appropriate `PROXY_TIMEOUT` values based on target server response times. Different timeout defaults apply:
  - HTTP client requests: 30s default
  - HTTP proxy responses: 60s default  
  - Socket connections: 30s default
  - Socket connection handling: 300s default
  - Set to 0 for infinite timeout (not recommended for production)
- **Log Level**: Use `debug` level cautiously in production as it logs full request/response bodies
- **Health Checks**: Configure monitoring systems to use `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor queue size and error rate metrics for capacity planning
